# üìå Overview

This repository contains code, methods, and visualisations for a mini-project in **Uncertainty Quantification IV**, completed as part of the MATH module at Durham University. The project focuses on developing and applying **Bayes Linear emulators** to understand and approximate computational models with uncertain inputs and outputs.

The analysis follows a structured approach based on the course practicals, progressing from simple one-dimensional emulation to efficient multi-dimensional implementations, including **multi-wave history matching**, **design diagnostics**, and **prediction interval analysis**.

# üéØ Objectives

- Explore the impact of uncertain inputs on physical models  
- Construct and test Bayes Linear emulators (1D and 2D)  
- Evaluate emulator performance through diagnostics and plots  
- Apply multi-wave history matching to refine input space  
- Compare emulator output to true function values for validation

# üß† Physical Model

The model used is the **rescaled Branin-Hoo function**, selected from the [Virtual Library of Simulation Experiments](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/index.html). It provides a realistic testbed for emulation due to its:

- Nonlinear behaviour
- Multiple global minima
- Interacting input dimensions

Inputs are scaled to the unit square \([0, 1]^2\) and evaluated using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for effective coverage.

# üî¨ Methodology

The main techniques demonstrated are:

- **Bayes Linear Emulation (BLE)**  
  - Construction of expectation and variance estimators  
  - Closed-form BL adjustments using covariance matrices  
  - Emulator training on sparse design points

- **1D and 2D Emulation**  
  - Fixing inputs and exploring response in 1D  
  - Full-grid contouring in 2D with uncertainty maps

- **Efficient Emulator Implementation**  
  - Optimised matrix inversion using Cholesky decomposition  
  - Pairwise distances computed via `pdist` for speed

- **Multi-Wave History Matching**  
  - Definition of observational discrepancy and error  
  - Implausibility scoring to exclude poor-fitting regions  
  - Sequential wave analysis to improve emulator focus

# üì¶ Requirements

The following R packages are used across the scripts:

```r
install.packages(c("plot3D", "lhs", "pdist", "sensitivity", "viridisLite"))
